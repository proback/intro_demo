## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. 

```{r gap2007}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/gapminder.csv")
gap07 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r gapplots, echo=FALSE}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, data = gap07)
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, data = gap07)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
